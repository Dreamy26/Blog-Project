    <h3>On the Wood 1</h3>
    <h6>First Wood Memory</h6>
    <p>Saturday nights,  was my favorite night of the week during junior high school.  It was the night all the teenagers would show up to the rink.  The OG skaters would skate trio and would work the middle. Most of us was content with just being seen and rolling on our 4's without falling. However, I was memerized with smooth gliders. </p>
